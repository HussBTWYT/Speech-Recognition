# Speech-Recognition
A module which defines the input being based on the microphone, programmed in Python.

# How to Use
Download the github repository, then create a recording of yourself, or find it online and upload it in the same folder as the speech_recognition.py 

# Please Note

For testing purposes, you must convert your audio file to a .wav
Website to do this if needed (MP3 TO WAV): https://cloudconvert.com/mp3-to-wav

# Current Issues

- Audio File must be a .wav, and cannot be any other specific file.
- If converting a normal audio file to a .wav, you cannot just rename the end of the file, or it will be corrupt.
